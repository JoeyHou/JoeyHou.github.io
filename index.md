I am a second-year master’s student in Data Science at [University of Pennsylvania](https://dats.seas.upenn.edu). I got my bachelor of science degree in Data Science at [UC San Diego](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/). In the past, I have worked in research projects in the field of procedure reasoning, data-mining, natural language generation, and computational psychology. 

My main research focus right now is **natural language understanding** and **commonsense reasoning**. More about my research expriences and projects can be found in **[about me](/about/)** page or in **[my cv](/doc/cv.pdf)**

Aside from NLP, I am also a fan of [cat feeding](https://www.instagram.com/coco.quinn555/), cooking Chinese cuisine, and travel.

- **Research**
    - Procedure Reasoning: building NLP models/systems to 1) generate "branching" options in a procedure (e.g. upgrade home security system) 2) generate rationales for each given options (e.g. why walking to school instead of taking a bus, or vice versa).
- **Personal**
    - [Justice](https://www.audible.com/pd/Justice-Audiobook/B002V1OC6Y) by *Michael J. Sandel*. I enjoy learning and thinking about moral philosophy in general. 
    - [江城](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Town:_Two_Years_on_the_Yangtze) by *Peter Hessler*. One of the most well-known works in the field of nonfiction story-telling; it always reminds me of the people and places I grew up from.
    - [Event Cognition](https://books.google.com/books/about/Event_Cognition.html?id=y8GiAwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description) by *Gabriel A. Radvansky, Jeffrey M. Zacks*. A psychological book about how human perceive events and stories, recommended by Yejin Choi, and I indeed love it.
