I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.cs.pitt.edu/) adviced by Professor [Xiang (Lorraine) Li](https://www.cs.pitt.edu/people/full-time-faculty/lorraine-xiang-li). I got my Master of Science in Engineering (M.S.E) degree in Data Science at [University of Pennsylvania](https://dats.seas.upenn.edu), where I worked with Professors [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/) and [Lyle Ungar](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/); I got my Bachelor of Science degree (B.S.) in Data Science at [UC San Diego](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/), where I worked with Professor [Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/), who was also my first mentor in the field of NLP.

My current research focus is **natural language understanding**, in particular, **commonsense reasoning**, **event-centric reasoning**, and **grounded language understanding**. More about my research expriences and projects can be found in **[my cv](/doc/cv.pdf)**

Aside from NLP, I am also a [cat person](https://www.instagram.com/coconut.joey/).
