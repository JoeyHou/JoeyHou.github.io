## About
- This page is inspired by [Zi Lin's homepage](https://github.com/zi-lin/zi-lin.github.io) and [so-simple-theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme)
- A few changes were made to personalize this website. With a little web-dev experience, I spent ~2hrs on it. So, I would definitely recommand this template for building personal webpage.
